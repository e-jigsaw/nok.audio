```markdown
# USER_CONTEXT
Add a new audio visualization component with waveform display.
```

### STATE
List the current state of components and features:
```markdown
# STATE
- Waveform visualization implemented
- Audio playback controls working
- Real-time updates functioning
- Basic styling applied
```

### TESTS
Document what was tested and results:
```markdown
# TESTS
- ‚úÖ Audio file loading
- ‚úÖ Waveform rendering
- ‚ùå Mobile responsiveness
- üü° Performance optimization needed
```

### CHANGES
List specific modifications made:
```markdown
# CHANGES
- Added WaveformVisualizer component
- Created audio processing utilities
- Updated main App component
- Added visualization styles
```

### DEPS
Document dependencies and versions:
```markdown
# DEPS
- react@18.3.1
- vite@5.4.2
- tailwindcss@3.4.1
- Additional audio processing libraries
```

### INTENT
Explain the goals and reasoning:
```markdown
# INTENT
- Enhance user experience
- Provide visual feedback
- Improve audio interaction
```

## Optional Sections

### NEXT_STEPS
Future tasks or improvements:
```markdown
# NEXT_STEPS
- Add frequency analysis
- Implement audio effects
- Optimize for mobile
```

### ISSUES
Known issues or limitations:
```markdown
# ISSUES
- Performance issues with large files
- Limited browser compatibility
```

## Example Summary

Here's a complete example of a session summary:

## Tips for Good Summaries

1. **Be Specific**: Include version numbers, file paths, and exact changes
2. **Use Emojis**: ‚úÖ ‚ùå üü° to indicate status clearly
3. **Keep It Structured**: Use consistent headings and formatting
4. **Include Context**: Help others understand why changes were made
5. **Think Future**: Note down next steps and known issues
